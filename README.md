# Orbit
My own small Java-based simulator, used to calculate the theoretical max altitude a model rocket could reach. 
The rocket is constructed via user-input, where the body and engine can be chosen. The values of these parts are stored in externally (locally) saved files, which are then used for the calculation. 
It uses the Tomorrow.io API to get current weather conditions, so the final calculation is adjusted accordingly.
